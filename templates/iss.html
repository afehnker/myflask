    <h1>Using APIs</h1>
    <p>This webpage shows how to make use of a couple of APIs. The website <a href="http://api.open-notify.org/">http://api.open-notify.org/</a>
    has two available APIs: one for the location of the International Space Station (ISS), and a live conuter
    of the amount of people currently in space. Probably useful for... something.

    With the Python <code>requests</code> library, you can retreive the coordinates on Earth above which the ISS is currently positioned.
    With the OpenCage API, you can input these coordinates to achieve all kinds of data, like the city, country, sunrise and sunset time,
    the name of the body of water if its not above land, et cetera. Using the <code>pprint</code> module, you can make JSON
        data appear nicely formatted in the Python console.
    </p>

    Using the ISS API, the following JSON formatted response:

    <pre><code>{{iss_data}}</code></pre>

    <p>The International Space Stations is currently at the following coordinates:
    {{lat}}, {{lon}} (Retrieved at <span class="output"></span> UTC).</p>

    According the OpenCage API, the ISS is now directly above {{location}}.
